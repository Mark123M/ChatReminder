# ReplyReminder

A Discord plugin that reminds you to reply to messages or just view them again. 

1. Auto-Reminder System: The plugin looks through dms and stores ongoing conversations into JSON. 
   For every interval of time (set by user), a modal will pop up to display the last messages that you haven't replied to.
2. Manual-Reminder System: Right click a message and click "Remind Me!" to set a reminder that displays a modal for the message
   after a set amount of time.
